minespect adds the inspect weapon functionality from CoD, CS, and TF2 into vanilla Minecraft (no mods required).

Currently, only Java edition 1.17 (snapshot 21w07a) is supported.

1. Download the resourcepack to .minecraft/resourcepacks

If you're not sure where to find .minecraft/, pause the game and select 'Resource Packs'. From there, select 'Open Resource Pack Folder' and navigate up one level.

## Usage
For now, the only functionality is to type ```/function inspect:inspect``` into the chat. If you forget the command, type ```/reload``` and click the prompt.
